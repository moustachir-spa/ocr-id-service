# OCR ID Service

Self-hosted, CPU-only OCR worker for extracting structured identity data from document images. The project is open source and currently optimized for Algerian national identity cards (CNI), including French/Latin and Arabic text. It uses PaddleOCR, OpenCV, Pydantic, and BullMQ-compatible Redis queues, with no cloud API, paid service, or GPU requirement.

## Current scope

Algerian CNI is the supported and tested document type. The classifier has experimental hooks for passports and driving licenses, but those formats are not yet guaranteed and should be treated as `unknown` or reviewed manually when confidence is low. The extractor is intentionally modular: additional document formats can be added with new language patterns, preprocessing profiles, and field extractors.

This project performs image OCR and heuristic document classification. It does not verify government records, read NFC/chips, prove biometric authenticity, perform face matching, or replace a KYC/identity provider. OCR results must be reviewed and validated against an authoritative record before making an identity decision.

## Architecture

A TypeScript or NestJS producer adds a `scan-id` job to the `algerian-id-ocr` BullMQ queue. The Python worker consumes it, scans the image, and stores the structured result as BullMQ's job `returnvalue`. Producers can listen with `QueueEvents` or inspect the job state and return value. Jobs accept `{ "image_path": "card.jpg" }` for a shared mounted directory or `{ "image_base64": "..." }` when the image must cross a host boundary.

The Python worker uses the official BullMQ Python library and the same Redis/Lua queue contract as the Node.js BullMQ package. No HTTP server is required; this makes it suitable as a standalone worker behind an existing backend.

## Requirements

- Python 3.11–3.13
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)
- Redis reachable through `REDIS_URL`
- CPU-only runtime; PaddlePaddle is installed with its CPU package

## Local development

```bash
cp .env.example .env
uv sync
uv run pytest
uv run ruff check .
uv run mypy app scripts
```

Start the worker in another terminal:

```bash
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379/0 uv run python -m app.main
```

The first real scan downloads PaddleOCR model files into Paddle's local cache. `OCR_LANGUAGES=fr,ar` enables French/Latin and Arabic recognition. Set `OCR_LANGUAGES=fr` or `OCR_LANGUAGES=ar` when a narrower workload is more important than bilingual coverage.

## CLI scan

The CLI performs a local scan without Redis and prints document classification, extracted fields, raw OCR text, and timing:

```bash
uv run python scripts/scan_image.py data/input/card.jpg --debug
```

With `OCR_DEBUG=true` or `--debug`, preprocessing stages, OCR detections, and the extracted result are written below `data/output/debug/<image-name>/`. Real identity images and generated output are ignored by Git.

## BullMQ producer example

```ts
import { Queue, QueueEvents } from 'bullmq';

const connection = { host: 'localhost', port: 6379 };
const queue = new Queue('algerian-id-ocr', { connection });
const events = new QueueEvents('algerian-id-ocr', { connection });
const job = await queue.add('scan-id', { image_path: 'card.jpg' });

events.on('completed', ({ jobId, returnvalue }) => {
  if (jobId === job.id) console.log(JSON.parse(returnvalue));
});
```

For separate containers or hosts, send `image_base64` instead of `image_path`; for a shared volume, mount the same image directory into both services. Keep the queue name, Redis database, and BullMQ prefix (`bull` by default) aligned. The CPU worker processes one job at a time by default and uses an extended lock duration because model inference can exceed BullMQ's default lock.

## TypeScript queue test client

Start Redis and the Python worker, install the optional TypeScript test dependencies, then submit an image:

```bash
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379/0 uv run python -m app.main
pnpm install
pnpm test:queue -- data/input/card.jpg
```

The client waits for the matching BullMQ result and prints the document verdict and extracted identity fields. The result includes `national_id`, `passport`, `driving_license`, or `unknown`; a biometric chip cannot be inferred from an image alone.

## Docker

This compose file runs only the OCR worker and expects Redis to be provided separately, so it does not create a second Redis instance:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit REDIS_URL so it is reachable from the container.
docker compose up --build
```

When Redis runs on the host, use a host-reachable address such as `redis://host.docker.internal:6379/0` where supported, or place the worker and Redis on the same user-managed Docker network. The `data/` directory is mounted for shared input images and debug output.

## Extraction and validation

The extractor recognizes French labels, Arabic text lines, spaced digits, common OCR label substitutions, and fuzzy label matches. It extracts `first_name`, `last_name`, `arabic_name`, ISO `birth_date`, `birth_place`, `gender`, 18-digit `nin`, and `document_number` when present. `validate_identity()` is a small explainable placeholder: NIN and birth date use exact matching, while names use fuzzy similarity.

## Privacy and security

Do not commit real identity images, OCR output, Redis credentials, or database records. Keep Redis private, restrict access to mounted data, and treat OCR output as sensitive personal data. This repository intentionally contains no sample identity documents.

## Contributing

Issues and pull requests are welcome. New document support should include representative synthetic or legally redistributable fixtures, extractor tests, and documentation of known limitations. Never submit real personal identity documents.
